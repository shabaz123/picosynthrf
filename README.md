This repo contains two main things:

(1) A copy of MicroPython firmware for the Pi Pico. This firmware supports double-precision floating-point maths, whereas the official MicroPython firmware for Pi Pico only supports single-precision.

(2) Python code which implements an Open Source RF Signal Generator. For more information, see the following URL:
